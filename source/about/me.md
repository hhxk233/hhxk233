# About Me

Hi! I'm **Yuheng Wang**, an undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in **Engineering Physics** at the University of Michigan and **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Iâ€™m also minoring in **Computer Science**. My academic interests lie at the intersection of physics, computation, and electronics.

With research experience spanning quantum transport, signal processing, and circuit design, I enjoy combining theoretical insight with hands-on experimentation. Currently, Iâ€™m exploring **non-Hermitian exciton-polariton transport** and working with **Ansys Lumerical** to simulate nanobeam cavities, while also gaining experience in **MoSeâ‚‚ monolayer fabrication**.

Previously, I worked on **machine learning for mmWave signal recognition** and **chip-scale wireless power transfer systems** using nonlinear dynamics. I also have experience teaching programming and analog circuits as a TA, and have contributed to workflow automation in educational contexts.

When Iâ€™m not doing research or coding, I like working on independent projects â€” from epidemic simulations using cellular automata to building 2D games in Elm.
